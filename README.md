This code demonstrates an uncommon error in TypeScript related to optional parameters. The function printName accepts an object with a required name property and an optional age property. When calling the function with an object that omits the optional age property, TypeScript throws an error.  This is a common misconception with the use of optional parameters, where it is not actually optional in the call to the function, and how to address it.
